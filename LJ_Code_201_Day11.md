#Daily Learning Journal - Day 11

##What's new

Today I made some progress by taking a little more time to think through the goals and my method for executing a plan. I still feel that I plod my way through assignments, but I felt a more confidence with today's lesson. I was able to display 3 random images in a row that refreshed when clicked. I intend to complete the reading for tomorrow before I go back to the assignment to potentially work on making sure the images aren't duplicated on the same or successive instances. But I feel like I made better progress today than any single day last week so I'm happy. I also have a decent idea of the direction I need to take for the next few steps... We shall see.

This was perhaps a little informal.  The bottom line is today was a good day.  Cheers!
