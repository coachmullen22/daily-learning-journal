# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 4

## Code Review
The code review was illuminating today, partially because I was able to fix my code, but more-so because seeing the thought process of the planning phase made the actual coding look easy and "elegant".

## Lecture CSS
I tried observing this lecture without taking many notes (to discover how valuable my note-taking actually is), and I found that most of the topics were logical and didn't need notes.  However I did make one note about how 'Absolute positioned elements are positioned against their nearest "relative positioned" parent. The relative container must be set as "relative positioned" to be work.'

I'll revisit that over the weekend to make sure I have that locked in.

## Functions
I think the biggest lesson for me is that multiple functions can be made to work to perform a given task, but one function may be more appropriate ("elegant looking") given the end-goal.

## Lab
The partner lab was extremely helpful for me. My partners (the Jeff's) have a little more experience than I do and they were able to coach me through my code fixes.  The actual process of turning our about_me project questions into functions was quite simple, but I appreciated the repetitions and having a three person group gave me an extra chance to see the "pull-request" process.

GOOD STUFF!!!
