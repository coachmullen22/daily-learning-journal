# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

## Today we discussed rules and preferred methods, or conventions, for writing code in HTML and JS. There is logic to the differences, although JS seems to give the author a few more acceptable choices. We also reviewed various processes for creating repo's, and the Add Commit Push, ACP, process. I've had trouble using Windows and I am aware that I need to get more familiar with navigating GitHub. I feel very much like a novice.

## The tasks I accomplished today included getting comfortable with the basic JS commands we were instructed to use. I set up the HTML portion of the page we're building and I started the CSS portion. I feel that I got bogged down in rules and frustrated by the difficulties with navigating between the terminal and atom. At times, I missed the first steps of instruction either because I'm slow or because I was working around a problem with my system. I'm hoping to have linex ready for tomorrow.
