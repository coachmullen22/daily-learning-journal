# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

# Today's Learning Lessons

Today was a challenge.  The biggest challenges for me were producing random outputs for each business hour, and then getting the results to print along with the daily total.  I got it done with some help but the logic of what I did is tenuous.  I think repetitions (both writing it out and talking it out) are needed.  Also, I find that I get the terminology jumbled at times.  Again, I need to talk out the code more...maybe I need one of those rubber duckies...
