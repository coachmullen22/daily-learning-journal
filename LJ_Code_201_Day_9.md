# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

# Today's Learning Lessons

I had two breakthrough's today. One was when my array actually worked (at the beginning of the day), and the other was at the end when all of my data appeared in the table. In between was a lot of testing and learning and debugging. The good news is I'm getting better. I'm also mentally exhausted. I think my mind will work itself into better shape gradually and I won't get so drained from the process. It's like getting back into the gym after a long layoff...
